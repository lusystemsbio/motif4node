#' @title Data file containing the topology of all 60212 non-redundant four-node gene circuits
#' @description This data contains the topology of all 60212 non-redundant four-node gene circuits.
#' @format A list of 60212 circuits, each element is a matrix of adjacency matrix. 
#' Four columns/rows represent genes "A", "B", "C", and "D".
#' In each adjacency matrix, 1 represents activation, 2 represents inhibition, and 0 represents no interaction.
